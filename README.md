# [gentopia.dev](https://gentopia.dev) - the generative place

Gentopia (“the generative place”) is a procedurally generated model of a post-civilization world.

_Metaphors: SimCivium, No Man’s Earth, Fractal Bioregionalism, Permaculture World..._

## Vision and scope

Envision a 3d model of Earth. As you zoom in, it starts showing meaningful areas of the world (biomes, watersheds, ecoregions, bioregions, ....) down to the level of individual villages and neighborhoods that can then be visited, ideally in VR mode.

What you see though is not the world as it _is_ now, but the way it _could be_, based on all sorts of sustainable/regenerative/post-civilizational design patterns and design languages.
